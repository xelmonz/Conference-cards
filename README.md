Instructions:
Replace the placeholder file paths (like 'final.xlsx', 'Identification card_page-0001.png', etc.) with the actual paths to your files.
Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed (qrcode, pandas, Pillow, and PyPDF2).

Output:
The script will create a final folder of PDFs that contain both the front and back images, along with the embedded QR code and the participant details.
